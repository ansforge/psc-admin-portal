# PscAdminPortal

Administration portal for sec-psc.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.2.

## Development

### License header check

The license header check gets performed as part of each container build. If the check fails,
the container build will fail. If this happens, use the [license/license-format.sh](license/license-format.sh)
script to draft the header bump commit. **Always** check the result before committing : the tool mostly works,
but in some corner cases (some partial match with the header with too much difference) it will make invalid change
that needs to be manually fixed.
